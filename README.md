Instructions : 
1. The project has explored two machine learning models SVM Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, with Random Forest Regressor achieving much lower Mean Squared Error and closer accuracy values.
2. The code for the project resides in the python notebook - EarlyStop.ipynb. Before running the notebook, make sure to load all the files in this directory to the runtime to avoid file import errors. (Suggested Environments - Google Colab)
3. The accuracy results for each of E values = [5,10,20,30,60] are present in 'Accuracy_predictions.csv' file along with the True Accuracies
4. For reproducing the results from the notebook without retraining, run notebook sections 1,2 and 8. These will import necessary files, clean data of missing values and use saved models to generate prediction and error values
5. For retraining the models on other E values, run code sections 1,2,7,8. This will train and save new models and generate new accuracy predictions.
